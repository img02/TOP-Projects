Memory card game

basics:   
    - page with randomly arranged 'cards'
    - score shown somewhere on screen (top corner?)
    - user must click on 'cards' to score
    - clicking of previously clicked 'card' results in game over




impl outline: keep it simple

-   Show some card components
        -   card consists of:
            - id
            - imgSrc
            - ??

        -   first just display numbered text
        -   Add images later (random cats + dogs?)
        -   onClick
            => fn(id) 
                {
                    if (prevClickedArr contains clicked, lose)
                    else score++
                }

-   Save clicked cards to array 
        -   useMemo?
        -   global / top parent state?

-    when card clicked
        - if not prev clicked
            - increase score
            
        - if already clicked 
            - reset score to 0
            - show popup / modal component
                - "game over"
                - "your score: {score}"
        - rearrange card order randomly

-   scoreboard component?
        - or just draw on main app render
        -   KISS
